# Example

Very simple example of how `react-dat-gui` can be used to mutate an object's properties in real time.

## Running

Simply

```
npm i
```

then

```
npm run start
```

And you should see the example open in your browser. Alternatively you can `npm run example` from the root directory of the repository.

## Create React App

This example has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), check out their docs if you want to learn more about how it all works.
