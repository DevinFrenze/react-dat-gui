# Dev

This is a dev app for developing changes to `react-dat-gui`.

## Running

Simply

```
npm i
```

then

```
npm run start
```

And you should see the dev app open in your browser. Alternatively you can `npm run dev` from the root directory of the repository.

## Migrating

You can migrate the latest source code to the dev app by running `npm run dev:migrate` from the root. This will copy all of the source code to `dev/src/react-dat-gui` as well as start the development server.

## Promoting

You can also promote your development code back to the root directory by running `npm run dev:promote` from the root directory.

## Create React App

This app has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), check out their docs if you want to learn more about how it all works.
